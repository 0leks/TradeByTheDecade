Encountered issue with per capita based export heat map visualization.
For USA 1980 code 2 exports per capita, small countries like Cyprus have a crazy high value compared to others so most of the
chart is black except for a few tiny countries that are a few pixels big that are bright red.
Obviously this doesn't make for a very useful or interesting visualization. 
Possible solutions:
Use a nonlinear distribution that will reduce the impact of the outliers on the colors.

Had issues aligning tooltip coordinates/list for dist chart
Had to use an "overlay" for dist chart so that the tooltip would always appear in the correct place
Realized late in process that we probably should show absolute values somewhere in chart, so that users can compare different product values.
