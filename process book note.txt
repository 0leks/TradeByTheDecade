Encountered issue with per capita based export heat map visualization.
For USA 1980 code 2 exports per capita, small countries like Cyprus have a crazy high value compared to others so most of the
chart is black except for a few tiny countries that are a few pixels big that are bright red.
Obviously this doesn't make for a very useful or interesting visualization. 
Possible solutions:
Use a nonlinear distribution that will reduce the impact of the outliers on the colors.
