# Trade Visualization Feedback from Jon, Haochen, Sinthia

Need careful explanation of the left side chart; it might be difficult for people to understand what the axis represent.
*Idea*: Animation transforming from pie chart to the horizontal bar chart. This would clearly explain to users what the size of the bars represents and how they fit into the dataset. But be careful about adding to many moving parts to avoid distracting users.

*Interaction Idea*: selecting a bucket on the left should light up countries on the right to clearly show association and/or drill down into specifics of the data.

*Suggestion*: Add some sort of currency exchange data for comparison with trade data. It would help show the general picture as well as showing a different perspective by adding something to compare against. Also jobs data (layoffs/hires per industry) could serve a similar role.

*Issue* with current design: How to assort the Exports and the Imports? Is the current column approach the best option or would it be better to use rows?

*Potential Improvement*: Split up the visualization into two screens. On the first put a huge world map and on the second put all of the charts. If the world map is used mainly for selection, then after selecting it would be nice to expand the data to take up the full screen.

*Ideas for additional visualizations*: Vertex network chart; a well done animation showing how the trade network changes over time would be awesome and an effective way to show a quick general overview. Threaded Pie Chart; might be poissible to show every relationship between countries using this but it also might be too cluttered and difficult to understand.

*Suggestion* for the head to head import/export chart ideas: To simplify the axis and representation, simply let the size of the bar represent the total trade between countries and let its position relative to the center line represent the export/import ratio which may skew one way or the other.
